# Stronghold Crusader 2 Editor Unlocker

This is a simple program that allows you to unlock the original maps of Stronghold Crusader 2 so that they can be modified using the map editor.

The program was created using the Python programming language and the PyQt5 library for the graphical interface.

To use the program, you need to run the unlocker.exe file included in the stronghold_map_unlocker.zip archive. To create this .exe file, the command `python compile.py build` was used (the compile.py file is present in the repository).

Once the program is launched, to unlock a map, click on the "Unlock Maps" button. You will be prompted to select the .shmap file to unlock. Once the file is selected, a new file with the extension "-unlocked.shmap" will be created (in the folder where the program is run) and it will contain the unlocked map.

Once the operation is complete, a confirmation message will be displayed.

## To use the script, install PyQt5 using pip, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pyqt5
```

To start the script map_unlocker.pyw, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed PyQt5 as described above.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the map_unlocker.pyw file is located.

3. Run the following command to start the script:

```
python map_unlocker.pyw
```

The script will open a window with the graphical interface of the Stronghold Crusader 2 Editor Unlocker program. You can then use the program to unlock maps as described in the description above.
